             I represented a disabled client who lost her initial benefit. Through deep investigation, I found her benefit was wrongfully granted; she was entitled to a
        <strong>permanent death pension</strong> from her deceased father. I won the federal case, securing
        <strong>five years of back payments</strong> and a new, permanent lifetime pension.

                </h3>
      <p class="card-text">This case involved an 83-year-old client who noticed unexplained deductions from his retirement payments. After a thorough investigation, I discovered that a private association had been unlawfully withdrawing funds for nearly four years without his consent. Despite the INSS claiming the deductions were authorized, no signed document existed. I filed a lawsuit against both the association and the INSS, and after an online hearing, we won — recovering all the wrongfully deducted payments plus compensation for moral and material damages.

      <p class="mb-0"style="color: white">
        In this project, I worked as a consultant for the legal team to optimize daily tasks. Using our own API and Python, we trained a model to recognize patterns in legal documents, reinforced with data from over 1,000 spreadsheets for accuracy. We also implemented NLP so the model could understand legal document contexts and automatically generate relevant tasks, such as identifying potential benefits or checking case deadlines.

      <h3>Project Hotei</h3>
      <p>This was a small risk analysys that i did for my post-degree conclusion project, that involves an AI assistant for building pettions, give lawyers some advices for juridical acts, and help with client support, making a profile of each type of client, and then making a personalized customer service.</p>

      <h3>Roraima State Indigenous People Project</h3>
      <p>This project was an enbrionary idea for bring my law firm services to Indigenous people from Roraima State, in northen part of Brazil, specially for the Yanomami tribe, since they had a challenging time in 2022, and they mostly lives on a isolated area. One of our main goals was to make a remote support for families that needs a goverment benefit, and helping with comunication, because most of the Yanomami's reserve doesn't have a properly internet conection.
        We also helped with some paid maternity leaves for indigenous women, and some retirement and disable pensions benefits for eldery people from the tribe.
